Imagine you're a painter with one restriction: you can't look at the canvas while you paint. You glance at a scene for one second, turn around, and recreate it from memory. Broad strokes first, capturing what matters most. Another glance, another second, more details emerge.

This process of distilling data into its core essence while preserving the most important details is called *dimensionality reduction*. An *autoencoder*, visualized here, is one such form of dimensionality reduction used in complex data like images, text, and audio.

Both reconstructions are blurry in some details, but brilliantly vivid in others. However, while the autoencoder builds a more accurate reconstruction of the image with time, human memory is eroded by significance, leaving more sentiment than detail. 

The AI reconstructs a picture of my friends and me smiling, wine glasses in hand. My mind reconstructs the taste of the college-budget wine, the feeling of realizing we’re out of toilet paper at 2am, and the drunken thrill of stealthily grabbing heaps of TP from the nearby McDonald's bathrooms. 

The AI reconstructs a picture of my 26th birthday party. My mind reconstructs the rush from hearing "SURPRISE", the taste of the custom-made hazelnut cake from the depths of Brooklyn, and the sight for sore eyes of my friends after years on opposite coasts.

The AI converges to a lossless reconstruction. My memory is boundless, spilling outside any frame.
